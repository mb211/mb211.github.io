      <td>Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans</td>
      <td>The Leatherback is the largest of all the sea turtles, and one of the largest reptiles on earth. The leatherback turtle ranges in size from 4-8 feet in length and weighs between 500-2,000 pounds. The average adult leatherback measures in between 5-6 feet and weighs 600-800 pounds. It is the oldest of all sea turtle species and has been around for more than 150 million years. They survived through the extinction of the dinosaurs and thrived until the last several decades when negative human interactions have taken a major toll on them.</td>

      <td>Sub-tropics and Tropics</td>
      <td>The green sea turtle is the second largest sea turtle after the leatherback turtle. Green turtles can weigh up to 500 lbs and reach four feet in length. Green turtles are herbivores, dining on sea grasses, seaweeds, algae and other forms of plants. Their beak is sharp and finely serrated, perfectly adapted for grazing in seagrass beds and scraping algae off of hard surfaces. This species is the only one to come on shore regularly to bask. Basking only occurs in Hawaii, particularly the Northwestern Hawaiian Island chain, the Galapagos Islands, and in some areas of Australia.</td>

      <td>Mainly the Caribbean Sea, the Seychelles, Indonesia, Mexico, and Australia</td>
      <td>Considered by many to be the most beautiful of sea turtles for their colorful shells, the hawksbill is found in tropical waters around the world. They spend their time in coral reefs, rocky areas, lagoons, mangroves, oceanic islands, and shallow coastal areas. Named for its narrow head and sharp, bird-like beak, hawksbills can reach into cracks and crevices of coral reefs looking for food. Their diet is very specialized, feeding almost exclusively on sponges. One of the smaller turtles, adults weigh between 100-200 pounds and reach 2-3 feet in length.</td>

      <td>One of the larger species of sea turtles, the loggerhead turtle ranges from 200-400 pounds and up to 4 feet in length. One of the most abundant of the species found in the US, they are named for their large head and strong crushing jaw (right) which enables them to eat hard-shelled prey such as crabs, conchs, and whelks.</td>

      <td>The second smallest after the Kemp’s ridley, the olive ridley turtles weigh between 75-100 pounds and reach 2-2 ½ feet in length. They are named for their pale green carapace and are the most abundant of sea turtle species.   Like the Kemp’s ridley, olive ridleys nest in mass referred to as an “arribada.” During arribadas, thousands of females may nest over the course of a few days. Adults reach sexual maturity around the age of 15 years.</td>

      <td>Gulf Of Mexico and the US's Atlantic Coast</td>
      <td>Until recently, the endangered Kemp’s ridley turtle was on the brink of extinction in the 1960's. Thanks to strict protection laws which protected their nesting beaches in Mexico and reduced accidental capture in fishing gear, the species has begun a slow, but steady comeback from a previous low of only 200 nesting individuals in the 1980’s, to an estimated 7,000 - 9,000 individuals today. These are the smallest of the seven sea turtle species, weighing between 75-100 pounds and measuring approximately 2 feet in length.

      <td>Australia</td>
      <td>The flatback turtle is named after its flat carapace, or shell, which is unlike the curved shell of other sea turtle species. The carapace is pale grayish-green in color with the outer margins distinctly upturned. An adult flatback weighs 200 pounds and is approximately 3 feet in length. They have the smallest distribution of all the species and breed and nest only in Australia.</td>
