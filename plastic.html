  <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;">Turtles and Plastic; Two things that do not mix very well. Why do turtles consume our plastic waste and how is this a problem for them?</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 17px;"> Turtles have varying diets, but many of them eat plants of some kind (algae for example).  This is where the confusion with plastic comes in for turtles;  They see a piece of plastic and they think that the plastic is their lunch.  Underwater the plastic looks exactly like food to the turtles, as their evolution (although amazing) didn't account for manmade plastics to be dumped into the ocean.  So this is the confusion and why turtles "stupidly" (although I believe not stupidly) eat plastic.  Once the plastic gets into the turtle it can do devastated things to it.  22% of turtles that eat just one piece of plastic die from it, sharp pieces of plastic can cut internals of turtles and even if the turtle survives all of that the plastic can make turtles unnaturally buoyant leading to problems with swimming and mating.</p>
  <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;">What can be done?</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 17px;">Unfortunately there is little the individual can do (apart from throwing away less plastic and helping clean-up efforts) because of the large scale of the problem. However, although one persons attempt may be futile many peoples attempts won't.  This is why this is a governmental problem regarding the cleanup of our oceans.  Governments (by own will or by pressure of citizens) must stand up and take accountibility for the pollution in our oceans and once they do that only then can progress be made to stop turtle suffering and cleanup our oceans. </p>
